            Hi, welcome on my webpage! (still under construction) 
            <br>
            I am a PhD student working in the field of applied maths.
            <br>
            Currently, I am working under the supervision of Emilie Chouzenoux and Víctor Elvira. 
            I am studying the minimization of statistical divergences such as the Rényi divergences using optimization methods based on Bregman divergences.
            I try to leverage these results to design efficient algorithms and better understand existing ones in the fields of adaptive importance sampling, variational inference, and global optimization.
            <br>
            I have also been working since my master thesis on biological models representing micro-organisms competing for a single limiting ressource.
            In particular, I have worked with Alain Rapaport on several questions related to the so-called periodic chemostat model, including optimal control in a periodic setting.
